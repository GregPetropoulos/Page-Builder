# Build-A-Page

## Description 

Build A Page is an application where the user can quickly and easily build eye catching and responsive templates. The user can choose from a single html page or multiple pages to use for the user’s website.  Our future improvements imply the site’s ability to publish to Github Pages.

## User Story
AS a user I want to generate an HTML landing page for my personal or commercial use.<br>
WHEN I go to the Build A Page application, I am presented with a landing page that allows the user to login/signup.<br>
THEN as a logged-in user, I want to be able to create my own custom layout.<br>
WHEN I click on templates I am able to choose from different options from heading, custom color and images to build my page.<br>
SO when I have completed my desired layout I am able to view, download or delete my template.<br>
